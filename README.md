# What is this?

The Guardian Project is a Jekyll website hosted as a Git Page on GitHub. This website is meant to do describe the world of a freeform multiverse-esque roleplaying environment. The pages in the Guardian Project detail the conceits of the shared roleplaying environment, and the universe that player characters will be acting within.

If you wish to know more about the universe of the Guardian Project, then you can get started by reading [our webpage](https://www.example.com)

Do not worry! Deep knowledge of programming, or of Git, is not required to contribute to the Guardian Project. Read on for step by step instructions for making your first contribution, and welcome!
